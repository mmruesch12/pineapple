# Project _Pineapple_

This project allows developer candidates to display their ability to deliver clean
and usable code using Angular in a timely manner. Candidates will receive feedback on their coding
style, substance, and completeness following the exercise.

_We've included all of the Angular Material framework in the project for your ease. Feel free to use it
at your discretion._

## Preparation

- [X] Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your
development machine
- [X] Fork this project into your personal GitHub repository
- [X] Review the project's file structure to prepare for tackling deliverables
- [X] From the command line, traverse into the project's root folder and run `npm install`
- [X] After installation completes, run `npm run start` and [open a browser window to view the
project](localhost:4200)

## Deliverables

- [X] Add a search filter for the table of device data. The user should be able to type a string of
text and see the collection of devices update in real time.
- [X] All tests should pass when executing the `npm run test` command in root.
- [X] After you've completed your work, send us a link to your remote repository along with a _brief_ overview of your solution.

## Bonus Deliverable

Feel free to use your creativity to provide any additional functionality and we would happily review that as well.
